GETTING COMMUNITY ENGINE RUNNING
==================================================================
1. From the command line:
    $ rails site_name (create a rails app if you don't have one already)
2. Install the engines plugin:
    $ script/plugin install git://github.com/lazyatom/engines.git
3. Put community engine plugin into plugins directory (use one of the following methods):

    # If you're not using git, and just want to add the source files:
    # Download a tarball from https://github.com/bborn/communityengine/tarball/master 
    # and unpack it into /vendor/plugins/community_engine

    # Using git, make a shallow clone of the community_engine repository:
    $ git clone --depth 1 git://github.com/bborn/communityengine.git vendor/plugins/community_engine

    # If you want to keep your community_engine plugin up to date using git, you'll have to add it as a submodule: 
    # http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#submodules

4. Create your database and modify your config/database.yml appropriately.
5. Delete public/index.html (if you haven't already)
6. Modify your environment.rb as indicated below:

      ## environment.rb should look something like this:
      ===============================================================
      RAILS_GEM_VERSION = '2.1' unless defined? RAILS_GEM_VERSION
      require File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), 'boot')
      require File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), '../vendor/plugins/engines/boot')

      Rails::Initializer.run do |config|
        #resource_hacks required here to ensure routes like /:login_slug work
        config.plugins = [:engines, :community_engine, :white_list, :all]
        config.plugin_paths += ["#{RAILS_ROOT}/vendor/plugins/community_engine/engine_plugins"]
  
        ... Your stuff here ...
      end
      # Include your application configuration below
      require "#{RAILS_ROOT}/vendor/plugins/community_engine/engine_config/boot.rb"

7. Modify each environment file (development.rb, test.rb, and production.rb) as indicated below:

      # development.rb, production.rb, and test.rb should include something like:
      ===============================================================
      APP_URL = "http://localhost:3000" (or whatever your URL will be for that particular environment)

8. Modify your routes.rb as indicated below:

      # Add this after any of your own existing routes, but before the default rails routes: 
      ===============================================================
      map.from_plugin :community_engine
      # Install the default routes as the lowest priority.
      map.connect ':controller/:action/:id'
      map.connect ':controller/:action/:id.:format'
      

9. Generate the community engine migrations: 
    $ script/generate plugin_migration
    
10. From the command line:
    $ rake db:migrate

11. You may need to change these lines in application.rb (if you're not using cookie sessions):
    # See ActionController::RequestForgeryProtection for details
    # Uncomment the :secret if you're not using the cookie session store
    protect_from_forgery # :secret => 'your_secret_string'
    
12. Run tests (remember, you must run "rake test" before you can run the community_engine tests): 
    $ rake test
    $ rake community_engine:test
13. Start your server and check out your site! 
    $ mongrel_rails start
    or
    $ ./script/server



## OPTIONAL CONFIGURATION ##
To override the default configuration, create an application.yml file in RAILS_ROOT/config 
===============================================================
The application configuration defined in this file overrides the one defined in /community_engine/engine_config/application.yml
This is where you can change commonly used configuration variables, like AppConfig.community_name, etc.
This YAML file will get converted into an OpenStruct, giving you things like AppConfig.community_name, AppConfig.support_email, etc.



## PHOTO UPLOADING  ##
By default CommunityEngine uses the filesystem to store photos.
To use Amazon S3 as the backend for your file uploads, you'll need the aws-s3 gem installed, and you'll need to add a file called amazon_s3.yml to the application's root config directory (examples are in /community_engine/sample_files). 
You'll need to change your configuration in your application.yml to tell CommunityEngine to use s3 as the photo backend.
Finally, you'll need an S3 account for S3 photo uploading.


## Create an s3.yml file in RAILS_ROOT/config (OPTIONAL) ##
===============================================================
CommunityEngine includes the s3.rake tasks for backing up your site to S3. If you plan on using these, you'll need to add a file in RAILS_ROOT/config/s3.yml. (Sample in sample_files/s3.yml)


## ROLES ##
CommunityEngine Users have a Role (by default, it's admin, moderator, or member)
To set a user as an admin, you must manually change his role_id through the database.
Once logged in as an admin, you'll be able to toggle other users between moderator and member (just go to their profile page and look on the sidebar.)
Admins and moderators can edit and delete other users posts.


## THEMES ##
To create a theme:
1. Add a 'themes' directory in RAILS_ROOT with the following structure:
/RAILS_ROOT
  /themes
    /your_theme_name
      /views
      /images
      /stylesheets
      /javascripts
      
2. Add 'theme: your_theme_name' to your application.yml (you'll have to restart your server after doing this)
3. Customize your theme. For example: you can create a /RAILS_ROOT/theme/your_theme_name/views/shared/_scripts_and_styles.html.haml to override the default one, and pull in your theme's styleshees.
To get at the stylesheets (or images, or javascripts) from your theme, just add /theme/ when referencing the resource, for example:

Note: when running in production mode, theme assets (images, js, and stylesheets) are automatically copied to you public directory (avoiding a Rails request on each image load). 

= stylesheet_link_tag 'theme/screen'  # this will reference the screen.css stylesheet within the selected theme's stylesheets directory.


## Other notes ##
===============================================================
Any views you create in your app directory will override those in community_engine/app/views. 
For example, you could create RAILS_ROOT/app/views/layouts/application.html.haml and have that include your own stylesheets, etc.

You can also override CommunityEngine's controllers by creating identically-named controllers in your applications app/controllers directory.


# Gotchas
1. I get errors running rake! Error: (wrong number of arguments (3 for 1)
  - make sure you have the latest version of rake
2. I get test errors after upgrading to Rails 2.1
  - make sure you have upgraded to the Engines 2.1 plugin, and modified your environment.rb to use Rails 2.1.


# Todo
- Track down "<RangeError ... is recycled object>" warnings on tests (anyone know where that's coming from?)
